## Welcome!

This is an effort to support new users of BGC Argo data led by PhD student Kimberlee Baldry from the University of Tasmania.

# User resources

The BGC Argo program is a network of robotic floats equiped with biogeochemical sensors. The program is at a pilot stage and data management procedures are still being developed. As a result, the program advises that users perform some level of quality control before scientific application. On this site you will find resources to help new and existing users navigate the program and it's associated data.
