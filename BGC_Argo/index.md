### The Biogeochemical Argo program

The [BGC-Argo program](https://biogeochemical-argo.org/) is a pilot observation network of robotic profiling floats. It is an extension of the established Argo program that includes the deployment of a suite of biogeochemical sensors. Due to the autonomous nature of the program tens of thousands of biogeochemical profiles have already been collected around the globe.
