# The Biogeochemical Argo program

The [BGC-Argo program](https://biogeochemical-argo.org/) is a pilot observation network of robotic profiling floats. It is an extension of the established Argo program that includes the deployment of a suite of biogeochemical sensors. Scroll through the [Argo](https://www.argo.ucsd.edu) story map to learn about how the program came about, and where it will go in the future!

Due to the autonomous nature of the program tens of thousands of biogeochemical profiles have already been collected around the globe! This effort is sustained by an international effort which requires the regular deployment of floats from ships. The program is not at full capacity which is working towards a global array of 1000 floats. Below shows the distribution of biogeochemical data collected as of August 2020.
